A neural network with 1 hidden layer and 4 hidden units have been built from scratch. 
The model is trained for 2000 epochs to demonstrate how the error terms between the actual and predicted y-values decrease with the increase in the number of epochs.

Language: Python

IDE: VS Code

Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
